# OenFace_ME_Demo
Frame analysis of Micro-Expressions detected from webcam

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 using Python 3.5
This work was developed using OpenFace (https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki) to extract features. Of particular interest for this demo are the intensities of the detected micro-expressions (https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Action-Units)
When you run the program, two windows will display (one showing the tracked video and another one showing the predicted ME).  When you want to stop recording, press the q key. You'll be taken to a new gui, where you can analyze each ME indepently along time (frames)
